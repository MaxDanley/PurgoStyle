            User and Company are agreeing to give up any rights to litigate claims in a court. Other rights that User
            would have if User went to court may also be unavailable or may be limited in arbitration. Any claim,
            dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, whether pre-existing, present, or future,

          </p>
          <p>
            All disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration in
            Maricopa County, Arizona before an arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the Company and User (the
            &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;). If the Parties are unable to agree mutually on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days
            after a written demand for arbitration is made, the matter shall be submitted to the American Arbitration
            Association (AAA) or its successor organization for binding arbitration in Maricopa County by a single
            arbitrator who shall be a former Arizona judge or an attorney licensed in Arizona with significant
            experience in commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA in an impartial manner
            determined by it. Except as may be otherwise provided herein, the arbitration shall be conducted under the
            Arizona Uniform Arbitration Act, A.R.S. § 12-1501 et seq. The Parties shall have the discovery rights
            provided under the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure as permitted by the arbitrator. The arbitration hearing
            shall be commenced within ninety (90) days of the appointment of the arbitrator, and a decision shall be
            rendered by the arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing. The arbitrator shall
            have complete authority to render any and all relief, legal and equitable, appropriate under Arizona law,
            including the award of punitive damages where legally available and warranted. The arbitrator shall award
            costs of the proceeding, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs, to the party or parties
            determined to have substantially prevailed. Judgment on the award can be entered in a court of competent
            jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            User may elect to pursue User&rsquo;s claim in Arizona small-claims court rather than arbitration if User
