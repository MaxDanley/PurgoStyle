            your use of the Website or Products or this Agreement. The Company&rsquo;s total liability for any claim arising
            from your use of the Website or purchase of Products shall not exceed the amount you actually paid the
            Company for the relevant order.
          </p>

          <h2>Returns and Customer Obligations</h2>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold uppercase text-gray-900">Returns:</span> Returns are governed by our{" "}
            <a href="/returns">Returns</a> policy. Sales are final except as stated in that policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold uppercase text-gray-900">Your Responsibilities:</span> By using or purchasing

            jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <h2>Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors, employees,
            agents, and assigns from and against any claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including
            reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising from your violation of this Agreement or your use of the Website or
            Products.
          </p>

          <h2>Website Availability</h2>
          <p>
            The Company strives to keep the Website available but does not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Website
            may be modified, suspended, or unavailable at any time without notice. The Company is not liable for any
            damages resulting from unavailability or changes to the Website.
          </p>

          <h2>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h2>
          <p>
            Any dispute or claim arising from or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Website or purchase of
            Products (including the validity or scope of this arbitration provision) shall be resolved exclusively by
            binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that either party may seek equitable relief in court
            and either party may bring an individual claim in small-claims court if it qualifies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arbitration shall be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona, under the rules of the American Arbitration
            Association (AAA) or a mutually agreed arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within
            thirty (30) days after a written demand for arbitration, the AAA shall appoint one. The arbitration shall
            be governed by the Arizona Uniform Arbitration Act, A.R.S. § 12-1501 et seq. The arbitrator may award any
            relief permitted by law, including costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees to the prevailing party.
            Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may opt out of arbitration and pursue your claim in Arizona small-claims court by sending the Company
            written notice within 60 days of the purchase giving rise to the claim. You and the Company waive any right
            to a jury trial and to participate in a class action.
          </p>

          <h2>General Provisions</h2>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold uppercase text-gray-900">Entire Agreement:</span> This Agreement, together with
            the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Website and
            Products and supersedes any prior agreements. No amendment is effective unless in writing by the Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold uppercase text-gray-900">Severability:</span> If any provision of this
            Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold uppercase text-gray-900">Waiver:</span> The Company&rsquo;s failure to enforce
            any right or provision does not waive that right or provision unless in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold uppercase text-gray-900">Force Majeure:</span> The Company is not liable for
            failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control (e.g., acts of God, natural
            disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, supply chain failures, or government action).
          </p>
